I used the record program to record the input data from the controller into a csv, which ended up being a lot of data.
The record program didnt put the data into roll pitch throttle column order so i had to do some excel messing around to get it into that
form, then i rounded the data into whole numbers to fit my execute program.
Then I played around with the csv data and the time sleep on the execute program to clean up the movement, because when recording, it was not the cleanest
run, there was a lot of self trimming the drone during flight, so I had to get rid of that.
