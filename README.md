# ENGR423-Midterm
Programming small drones


This is a midterm project for the class ENGR 423 with Professor Pramod Abichandani, in which I worked on with my partner.
ENGR 423 is a class where we programmed small (about the size of an adult face) drones to do various tasks, all the code is written in PYTHON 3.7.

The tasks that I had a hand in programming were:

1. Write a python program for two drones to fly in the following shapes together as a swarm.
  -Square
  -Triangle
  -Circle (as good of a circle as you can)
2. Create a CSV file using EXCEL/Google Sheets that has the values of roll, pitch, and throttle stored as follows:
(read this part raw github doesent line up the stuff)
Roll|Pitch|Throttle
15    23    1
-23   9     -1
........ and so on.
Write a python program to read these values from the CSV and execute the corresponding drone motion commands.

3. Obstacle Course
Create an obstacle course and have your drone fly through a fixed obstacle course semi autonomously using a python file. 
Keep in mind the obstacle course should stay fixed and not change.


NOTE: The files labeled EXECUTE, RECORD, and README_Q3 are part of the Obstacle Course.
